## 1.Creational design patterns

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns
and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process,
object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.


### 1.1 Abstract Factory
Creates an instance of several families of classes

### 1.2 Builder
Separates object construction from its representation

### 1.3 Factory Method
Creates an instance of several derived classes

### 1.4 Object Pool
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use

### 1.5 Prototype
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

### 1.6 Singleton
A class of which only a single instance can exist


## 2. Structural design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to
compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.


### 2.1 Adapter
Match interfaces of different classes

### 2.2 Bridge
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

### 2.3 Composite
A tree structure of simple and composite objects

### 2.4 Decorator
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

### 2.5 Facade
A single class that represents an entire subsystem

### 2.6 Flyweight
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

### 2.7 Private Class Data
Restricts accessor/mutator access

### 2.8 Proxy
An object representing another object


## 3. Behavioral design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most
specifically concerned with communication between objects.


### 3.1 Chain of responsibility
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

### 3.2 Command
Encapsulate a command request as an object

### 3.3 Interpreter
A way to include language elements in a program

### 3.4 Iterator
Sequentially access the elements of a collection

### 3.5 Mediator
Defines simplified communication between classes

### 3.6 Memento
Capture and restore an object's internal state

### 3.7 Null Object
Designed to act as a default value of an object

### 3.8 Observer
A way of notifying change to a number of classes

### 3.9 State
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

### 3.10 Strategy
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

### 3.11 Template method
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

### 3.12 Visitor
Defines a new operation to a class without change
